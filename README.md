## 2017 Surface water state and trend analysis
Water quality analyses from New Zealand rivers and streams, collected by Regional, Unitary authorities and NIWA (generally on a monthy basis), is a growing set of data with national scope. This data is administered and managed by respective collection agencies. The established network of sites, under monitoring, is guided by existing impacts and policy outcomes, rather than necessarily driven by national representativeness (with the exception of sites monitored by NIWA).

For LAWA, a pragmatic approach has been adopted to simply present the sites available. These sites are compared with one another, and with other 'like' sites, in order to establish where a particular site fits in the NZ story. 'Like' sites are determined on the basis of similar land cover or similar altitudinal range.
